### WINNERS' PIZZA POINT

After realizing a high demand of Pizza consumption, I decided to fill up the gap by starting a restaurant named 'WINNERS' PIZZA POINT'. This restaurant is located at Juja mall-Kiambu in Kenya. If you can't reach or locate the place,no big deal,we can reach out to you.That's why we deal with pizza making and delivery to whichever place you wish.The pizzas are in the mega,large,medium and small sizes.The different kinds of crust include:Thin crust,flatbread crust,thick crust and focaccia. The toppings include: Pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, sausage, bacon, extra cheese, black olives and green peppers. Prices differ according to difference in size, topping and crust flavors,though discounts are given when customers purchase in large quantities.
